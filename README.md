# 30Days-SQL-Challenge

## Overview
I participated in a 30-day SQL challenge organised by Techavilly. Throughout this challenge, we worked on four datasets. I was tasked with using my SQL skills to solve business questions as required by the company.

## Data Cleaning

The datasets required some cleaning before they could be worked on. You can find the codes I used in cleaning the data and the process I took [here](https://github.com/Ratafar22/30Days-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Data_Cleaning.sql)
